## <font color='red'> Introduction </font>

Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies
and aggregate telemetry data. Istio's control plane provides an abstraction
layer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes.

Istio is composed of these components:

- **Envoy** - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic
   between services in the cluster and from a service to external
   services. The proxies form a _secure microservice mesh_ providing a rich
   set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers,
   policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting
   functions.

  > Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It
  > simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each
  > other over the network provided by the underlying platform.

- **Istiod** - The Istio control plane. It provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management. It consists of the following sub-components:

    - **Pilot** - Responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.

    - **Citadel** - Responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.

    - **Galley** - Responsible for validating, ingesting, aggregating, transforming and distributing config within Istio.

- **Operator** - The component provides user friendly options to operate the Istio service mesh.

The Istio project is divided across a few GitHub repositories:

- [istio/api](https://github.com/istio/api). This repository defines
component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio platform.

- [istio/community](https://github.com/istio/community). This repository contains
information on the Istio community, including the various documents that govern
the Istio open source project.

- [istio/istio](README.md). This is the main code repository. It hosts Istio's
core components, install artifacts, and sample programs. It includes:

    - [istioctl](istioctl/). This directory contains code for the
[_istioctl_](https://istio.io/docs/reference/commands/istioctl.html) command line utility.

    - [operator](operator/). This directory contains code for the standalone
[Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/standalone-operator/).

    - [pilot](pilot/). This directory
contains platform-specific code to populate the
[abstract service model](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#pilot), dynamically reconfigure the proxies
when the application topology changes, as well as translate
[routing rules](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/) into proxy specific configuration.

    - [security](security/). This directory contains security related code,
including Citadel (acting as Certificate Authority), citadel agent, etc.

- [istio/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy). The Istio proxy contains
extensions to the [Envoy proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) (in the form of
Envoy filters) that support authentication, authorization, and telemetry collection.
