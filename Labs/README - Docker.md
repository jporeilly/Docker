## <font color='red'> Introduction </font>

Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Docker Engine is composed of these components:

- **Docker Daemon** - A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the dockerd command).

- **REST API** - A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do

- **CLI** - A command line interface (CLI) client (the docker command).
